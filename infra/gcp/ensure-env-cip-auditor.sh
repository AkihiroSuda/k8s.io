# Wire up the AUDITOR_SERVICE_NAME to receive events from GCR. This script only
# needs to be run 1x after the first deployment of the auditor, as long as
# AUDITOR_SERVACE_NAME doesn't change. Also, the "ensure-prod-storage.sh" script
# must run before this script, because that script creates both the
# AUDITOR_INVOKER_SVCACCT (used by this script) and the AUDITOR_SVCACCT (used by
# cip-auditor/deploy.sh).
#
# So the sequence should be:
#
# - Run ensure-prod-storage.sh
# - Run deploy.sh
# - Run this script.
#
# Thereafter, new deployments of the auditor only requires running the deploy.sh
# script.
